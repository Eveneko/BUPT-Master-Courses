Hello, everyone. Thank you for coming to today's talk.

I am a Master's student in cyberspace security. The work that I am going to present to you today was  "Towards Automatically Fixing Vulnerable Smart Contracts". 

In this presentation, I am going to discuss some findings of the vulnerabilities in smart contracts and how to fix them automatically. 

I will begin by introducing the background knowledge about the smart contract. Then I will give a simple example to demonstrate the overall workflow of this framework. After that, I will explain how the dependencies are symbolically analyzed in the background. Finally, I conclude my task with a result summary.
